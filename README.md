# Retail-Store-Sales-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting retail store sales, aiming to assist businesses in making informed decisions and optimizing their operations. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aimed to provide accurate sales forecasts and valuable insights.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized Python, pandas, and scikit-learn for comprehensive data cleaning and preparation.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied regression techniques to extract meaningful features for sales prediction.
  
- **Categorical Data Handling**: Employed One-Hot Encoding to effectively manage categorical variables in the dataset.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to uncover data patterns, correlations, and insights.

- **Modeling Strategies**: Developed and trained various machine learning models, including single and store-specific models.
  
- **Regularized Regression**: Implemented Regularized Regression techniques (Lasso and Ridge) to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

- **Ensemble Methods**: Utilized ensemble methods, particularly Random Forests, for robust and accurate predictions.

- **Time-Series Analysis**: Trained time-series models to identify yearly trends and seasonal patterns in retail sales data.

## Results

- Successfully built models that provide accurate sales forecasts, aiding businesses in demand planning and resource allocation.

- Outperformed traditional machine learning models through the utilization of advanced techniques.

- Improved model robustness and generalization using Regularized Regression.

- Identified and leveraged seasonal and yearly trends in the data for better predictive performance.
